# Pewpewpew-Pitch-Glider
Inspired by Greg Kubacki's guitar performance in "Dissect Yourself" this is a M4L device that recreates the rapid pitch gliding effect that defines the track.

Parameters:
1. Attack: the time taken for the initial glide-down of the pitch envelope
2. Decay: the time taken for the pitch glide to reach the trough of the pitch envelope, which is 24 semitones below the note played
3. Threshold: the minimum level at which the pitch envelope will be activated and applied
4. Gate: adjust the signal-to-noise ratio for the patch to improve input pitch detection and result in a smoother pitch envelope
5. Dry/Wet: adjust the dry/wet signal ratio of the effect

How to use:
Putting this device first in the signal chain is recommended for most cases. This will allow the patch to receive the clean guitar signal without alteration and result in a smoother pitch enveolope and a cleaner-sounding pitch glide with no undesirable pitch flutuation.
